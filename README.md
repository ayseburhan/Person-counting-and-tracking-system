# PERSON COUNTING AND TRACKING SYSTEM
The main purpose of this project is to detect people on a video file using the YOLO model for object detection, and then track, follow, and count their transitions in specific areas.

## Technologies and Tools Used:


- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Ultralytics, OpenCV, cvzone
- Model: YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model
- Algorithms: SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Files and Resources: Video file, pre-trained weights (Yolo-Weights), visual resources such as mask.png
- Video Source: Video footage captured in a specific area or environment (e.g., footage from a security camera).
- Coordinates of Specific Areas: Coordinates of the areas where tracking or counting will be performed.
